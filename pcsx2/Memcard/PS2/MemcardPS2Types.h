// Size of a memcard, counted in sectors. Datatype is u32.
// 
// Memory cards by Sony are always 8 MiB of raw capacity (excluding ECC).
// Third party memory cards have been spotted in the wild up to 256 MiB.
// The PS2 memory card file system has a theoretical upper limit of 2 GiB;
// this size uses all available positions in the indirect FAT cluster list,
// in order to describe an indirect FAT large enough to describe a FAT, large
// enough to describe the directory tree, large enough to contain the data of
// the memcard's writeable portion. That was a run-on but I think it gets the
// point across.
// 
// Memory cards in PCSX2 are not immune to (all) the stability issues that real
// PS2 memory cards had. Certain games will reject cards larger than 8 MiB, or
// do dangerous I/O which can brick the memcard if it is not a standard size.
// The only scenario we are safe from is a third party memcard which used low
// quality NAND flash that was error prone and would corrupt data just from
// normal operation. This is an important consideration, because 
// 
// The PS2 memcard file system has its 2 GiB upper limit, but it does seem to retain
// some basic functionality up to even 8 GiB and can successfully format itself,
// successfully reporting up to 8 GiB of capacity in the BIOS. However, because the
// capacity reported based on the sector count information does not actually match
// the capacity available in the FAT, the memcard will almost certainly fail I/O
// operations in some capacity and behave unpredictably. At best, one or a few games
// may be able to operate on it but any sustained use will inevitably kill save files
// at best, the entire memcard at worst.
